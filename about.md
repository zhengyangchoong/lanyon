This page will feature occasional blog posts but mostly serves as a profile page of sorts as a replacement for LinkedIn. 

I am currently awaiting two years of purgatory before a university education. In the mean time, I'll be reading, writing, and studying, and I'm leaning towards a major in both philosophy and a hard science. 

Main contributor to [photonLauncher](https://github.com/sunjerry019/photonLauncher), the code repo for a high school photonics lab. Developed an interface (library?) for Lecroy equipment dating back to 1999, along with wrappers to communicate with other USB devices found in the lab.
